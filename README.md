# **🫀 Heart Disease Prediction 🚨 | Machine Learning Project**

Welcome to a data-driven deep dive into predicting heart disease using clinical health data and machine learning! This project is part of my journey into real-world ML applications where every data point could be a life-saving insight.

## **📌 Project Overview**

The goal? Build a model that can predict the presence of heart disease using structured medical data such as age, cholesterol levels, resting ECG results, and more.

Using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, I created a clean ML pipeline with a focus on exploratory data analysis, feature interpretation, and model evaluation.

## **🧠 What I Did**

- 🔍 Cleaned and explored real-world patient data

- 📊 Visualized feature patterns and distributions

- 🧪 Built and evaluated a classification model

- 🩺 Applied ML to an impactful healthcare use case

This project showcases not just technical implementation but also critical thinking and data storytelling.

## **🧾 Dataset Details**

- Format: CSV (heart.csv)

## **Attributes:**

- age: the age of the patient in years.

- sex: the sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).

- cp: the type of chest pain the patient experienced (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic).

- trestbps: the resting blood pressure of the patient in mm Hg.

- chol: the serum cholesterol level of the patient in mg/dl.

- fbs: the fasting blood sugar level of the patient, measured in mg/dl (1 = high, 0 = low).

- restecg: the resting electrocardiographic results of the patient (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy).

(Resting electrocardiographic (ECG or EKG) is a non-invasive diagnostic test that records the electrical activity of the heart while the patient is at rest. The test is performed using an electrocardiogram machine, which records the electrical signals produced by the heart through electrodes placed on the chest, arms, and legs.)

- thalach: the maximum heart rate achieved by the patient during exercise. exang: whether the patient experienced exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).

- oldpeak: the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. slope: the slope of the ST segment during peak exercise (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).

(ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest Oldpeak, also known as ST depression, is a common parameter measured during an exercise stress test to evaluate the presence and severity of coronary artery disease. It represents the amount of ST segment depression that occurs on an electrocardiogram (ECG) during exercise compared to rest.)

- ca: the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).

(The number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy is a parameter that is used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who undergo coronary angiography)

- thal: the type of thallium scan performed on the patient (1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect, 3 = normal).

- target: the presence of heart disease in the patient (0 = no disease, 1 = disease present).
